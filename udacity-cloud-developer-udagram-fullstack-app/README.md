# Udagram 

Udagram is a simple cloud application developed along side the Udacity Cloud Engineering Nanodegree. It allows users to register and log into a web client, post photos to the feed, and process photos using an image filtering microservice.

The project is split into three parts:
1. The Simple Frontend
A basic Ionic client web application which consumes the RestAPI Backend. 
2. The RestAPI Backend a Node-Express server which can be deployed to a cloud service.
3. The Image Filtering Microservice the final project for the course. It is a Node-Express application which runs a simple script to process images.
