# Overview

This repository contain project files from the ALX-T Udacity Cloud Developer Nanodegree Programme

## udacity-cloud-developer-monolith-to-microservice
In this project, I took an existing monolith application, converted and extended it into microservices. After the application was divided into smaller service, it was containerized and deployed to a Kubernetes cluster. This includes the deployment pipeline, scalability, observability, services, networking, and deployment strategies to service the software
